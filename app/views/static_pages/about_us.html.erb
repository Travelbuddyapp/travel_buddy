      How we stand out
    </h5>
    <p class="flow-text">We wanted similate a real work environment as much as possible. To do so, we created seperate Develop, Staging, and Production branches and Heroku Servers. Furthermore, we have seperate buckets on Amazon Web Services to keep our QA environment from interupting our production environment, while allowing us to really test our product before each production release.</p>
